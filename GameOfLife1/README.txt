MANUAL

To start playing the game you simply need to execute main and then type a number that isn't 9.
This will lead you to the user interface which will prompt you to enter a number from 0 to 8 with instructions telling you
what command will be performed for each number.

"*"'s are live cells.
"."'s are dead cells.

Assumptions made:

I made the assumption that an infinite 2-dimensional grid was a 2d array of a finite size but
which wrapped around itself when it came to counting neighbours of cells.


Notes:
I have included both JavaDocs and Junit tests however not all test methods contain assertions hence aren't Junit.

Improvements I could make:
Being able to have the menu right away rather than typing a number first.
Characters instead of numbers for commands.
